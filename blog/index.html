<p>ThoCode.net may allow third parties to use Cookies on the Websites and Apps to collect the same type of Personal Data for the same purposes ThoCode.net does for itself. Third parties may be able to associate the Personal Data they collect with other Personal Data they have about you from other sources. We do not necessarily have access to or control over the Cookies they use.</p>

<p><strong><em>Disabling the display of Targeted Ads through our App</em></strong> </p>
<p>We may facilitate the display of targeted advertising on other platforms, such as on other online platforms that you may be a user of.</p>
<p>You may be able to limit our use of your Personal Data to display targeted advertisements on behalf of our advertisers, by adjusting your preference through the Apps. Depending on the type of phone and operating software that you are using, you may be granted the option to disable our use of mobile identifiers (such as Apple’s IDFA or Google’s GAID) and the ability to track you across apps and websites owned by other companies by adjusting the settings available on your mobile devices.

<p>Although we will not use your Personal Data to show you such targeted advertisements on other platforms, you may still see generic ads that appear relevant to you.

<p>The original of this Notice is written in the English language. In the event of any conflict between the English and other language versions, the English version shall prevail.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>ADDENDUM 1: ThoCode.net FOR BUSINESS</strong></p>
<p><strong>I. INTERPRETATION</strong></p>
<p>All capitalised terms but undefined terms used herein shall bear the same meaning as those defined in the Terms of Use and ThoCode.net’s Privacy Notice.</p>
<p>This Addendum forms part of the Privacy Notice. In the event of any inconsistency between the Privacy Notice and this Addendum, this Addendum shall prevail.</p>
<p><strong>II. ThoCode.net’S RELATIONSHIP WITH USERS AND CLIENTS</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>How ThoCode.net for Business works</em></strong></p>
<p>ThoCode.net for Business is provided as an add-on feature to facilitate corporate billing for the Authorised Users’ use of ThoCode.net’s Services in the course of work.</p>
<p>When an organisation (“<strong>Client</strong>”) chooses to utilise ThoCode.net for Business, the Authorised User is given the option of tagging his/her rides or other transactions to the Client or to tag it as a personal ride. An Authorised User is referred to in the Privacy Notice as a passenger of driver partners.</p>
<p>As part of this feature, ThoCode.net will disclose detailed trip and booking information that Authorised Users have tagged as being for business purposes to the Client. Apart from this, ThoCode.net does not disclose other Personal Data of its Authorised Users to the Client.</p>
<p>Alternatively, an individual user may choose to set up a business profile within the Apps to facilitate the tagging of business-related rides and to generate consolidated trip reports to facilitate the submission of claims from his or her employer. When used in this mode, the claims process is user-driven and the user’s employer need not be a Client.</p>
<p>For ease of reference, Authorised Users and individual users will each be referred to as a “User” and collectively as “<strong>Users</strong>” in this Addendum.</p>
<p><strong><em>ThoCode.net is a data controller, so are our Clients</em></strong></p>
<p>In respect of any User and the processing of all their Personal Data (including but not limited to Linking Data and Portal Data), <strong>ThoCode.net acts as a data controller</strong>. For further information on how ThoCode.net collects, uses and discloses Users’ Personal Data, please refer to the Privacy Notice.</p>
<p>Due to the way ThoCode.net for Business works, ThoCode.net does not process any Personal Data for and on behalf of the Client. Accordingly, <strong>ThoCode.net is not the data processor of the Client</strong>, but <strong>an independent data controller</strong> in respect of all Personal Data that it processes in the course of providing the ThoCode.net for Business feature. Likewise, the Client is an independent data controller of the Personal Data (e.g. the Linking Data and Portal Data) that it discloses to and/or receives from ThoCode.net.</p>
<p>As independent controllers, ThoCode.net and the Client individually determine the purposes and means of processing Personal Data, subject to the provisions set out in the Terms of Use and this Privacy Notice. ThoCode.net and the Client are also individually responsible to ensure the protection of Personal Data under their charge.</p>
<p><strong>III.</strong>   <strong>WHAT PERSONAL DATA IS COLLECTED, PROCESSED AND DISCLOSED</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>What ThoCode.net collects as part of ThoCode.net for Business</em></strong></p>
<p>In order to provide the ThoCode.net for Business feature, the individual user or the Client will be required to provide the following information about the Authorised User to ThoCode.net:</p>
<ul>
<li>full name;</li>
<li>business email address; and</li>
<li>other identifying information about the Authorised User as reasonably requested by ThoCode.net.</li>
</ul>
<p>ThoCode.net will use this information for the purposes of:</p>
<ul>
<li>authenticating the User;</li>
<li>where applicable, linking the Authorised User’s account with the Client’s ThoCode.net for Business account or tracking the Authorised User’s business profile bookings on the Apps, as the case may be;</li>
<li>where applicable, verifying the Corporate Billing status of such Authorised User from time to time; and</li>
<li>contacting the User in accordance with the purposes set out in the Privacy Notice .</li>
</ul>
<p>Upon onboarding such User to the Apps, ThoCode.net will process the Personal Data of the User in accordance with the Privacy Notice and this Addendum.</p>
<p><strong><em>What ThoCode.net discloses to its Clients</em></strong></p>
<p>ThoCode.net will disclose relevant trip and booking information as determined by ThoCode.net from time to time to the Client to facilitate Corporate Billing.</p>
<p><strong><em>What ThoCode.net discloses to its individual user</em></strong></p>
<p>Depending on the business profile settings selected by the individual user, the user may retrieve and generate reports containing his/her relevant trip and booking information.</p>
<p><strong>IV.    PARTIES’ OBLIGATIONS</strong></p>
<p>The Client and ThoCode.net shall each:</p>
<ul>
<li>individually inform their data subjects of how each processes Personal Data and allow their data subjects to exercise their rights under the local data protection/data privacy laws;</li>
<li>comply with the obligations applicable to each party under the applicable data protection/data privacy laws when processing any Personal Data of the Proposed or Authorised Users;</li>
<li>obtain the necessary consents (if applicable) to facilitate the provision of the ThoCode.net for Business feature; and</li>
<li>implement appropriate legal, technical and organisational measures to protect Personal Data against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against unauthorised loss, destruction, damage, alteration, or disclosure, as well as any breach or attempted breach of each party’s security measures (“<strong>Information Security Incident</strong>”).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ADDENDUM 2: GRABDEFENCE PRIVACY STATEMENT</strong></p>
<p>This Privacy Statement (“<strong>Statemen</strong>t”) describes how GrabTaxi Holdings Pte. Ltd., its respective subsidiaries, affiliates, associated companies and jointly controlled entities (collectively “<strong>ThoCode.net</strong>”, “<strong>we</strong>”, “<strong>us</strong>” or “<strong>our</strong>”) collect, use, process and disclose data through use of GrabDefence and its related services (“<strong>GrabDefence</strong>”).</p>
<p>ThoCode.net provides its customers (“<strong>GD Customers</strong>”) with the GrabDefence service that helps to prevent, detect, and combat fraud or unsafe activities on their platforms and applications (such as web-based and mobile applications based e-commerce platforms) (“Digital Platforms”). GD Customers will integrate GrabDefence into their Digital Platforms to proactively capture data which helps to identify potentially fraudulent activities on their Digital Platforms.</p>
<p>This Statement applies to the users of GD Customers’ Digital Platforms (“<strong>you</strong>”), and strictly relates to the data collected, used and disclosed on behalf of GD Customers for the purposes of providing GrabDefence. Kindly refer to the applicable terms of service and/or privacy notices of the GD Customers to understand how they otherwise collect, use and disclose your data.</p>
<p>Please note that GrabDefence only collects information from the users of GD Customers’ Digital Platforms, details of which are shared in this statement.</p>
<p><strong>I.    COLLECTION OF DATA</strong></p>
<p>To provide GrabDefence to GD Customers, information from your device and information relating to your use of GD Customers’ Digital Platform will be collected. Such information include device identifier information (such as IMEI, Android ID, MAC address etc), device and hardware information (such as device name, screen size etc) as well as other contextual data in relation to your use of GD Customers’ Digital Platforms (such as IP address, Wifi address, GPS location data, etc).</p>
<p>We may combine the information we have collected to derive insights on a particular device (for example, insights on whether there are signs of app modification, data manipulation, device tampering, GPS spoofing). We do not attempt to personally identify you based on the information above in order to provide GrabDefence to GD Customers.</p>
<p>The information on your device that we collect above is done when you interact with GD Customers’ Digital Platforms, for example, when you launch the Digital Platform on your device or when you make a transaction on the Digital Platform.

<li>responding to any law enforcement request or court order.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please be assured that the information collected of your device will not be used by ThoCode.net for any marketing efforts or combined with any other datasets available to ThoCode.net in a manner that unfairly prejudices you.</p>

<li>Our legal advisors, law enforcement officials and government authorities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Save for the abovementioned parties, we will not disclose your information to any other third party.</p>
<p><strong>IV.    YOUR RIGHTS OVER YOUR DATA</strong></p>
<p>In accordance with applicable privacy laws and to the extent that any information collected pursuant to the use of GrabDefence may constitute personal data, you may be entitled to access or update your personal data. Given that GrabDefence’s processing of your personal data is premised on GD Customers’ use of GrabDefence when you use their Digital Platforms, if you would like to exercise your rights, we recommend that you directly approach the operator of the Digital Platform you are using to obtain more information about how your information is used and processed, and to exercise your rights over your personal data.</p>
<p><strong>V.    RETENTION OF DATA</strong></p>

<p>Nevertheless, please understand that the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure.

          <span class="post-date">2 Jun 2022</span>
          <h1 id="1-nuget-là-gì">1. Nuget là gì?</h1>
<p>Đã có người trả lời câu hỏi này rồi, nên bạn cứ coi ở đây: <a href="https://anhdung.me/2015/04/02/nuget-la-gi/">https://anhdung.me/2015/04/02/nuget-la-gi/ </a></p>
<p>Thật ra, nếu mà bạn không biết <a href="https://anhdung.me/2015/04/02/nuget-la-gi/">Nuget là gì</a> thì chắc cũng không cần phải coi thêm mấy bước sau chi nữa đâu.</p>
<h1 id="2-đăng-ký-tài-khoản-trên-nuget-org">2. Đăng ký tài khoản trên nuget.org</h1>
<p>Vào <a href="https://www.nuget.org/">https://www.nuget.org/</a> là xong thôi. Nuget hiện chỉ cần có Microsoft account (chẳng hạn như Office 365, các dịch vụ mail xưa nay hotmail/ outlook/ live) là có thể Signin vô được.</p>
<p>Signin vô được rồi thì click vô account name của mình, chọn mục API Keys rồi click Create để tạo key. Tạo xong nhớ copy để xuống bước 3 mình có mình xài nghen.</p>
<h1 id="3-build-code-và-publish">3. Build code và publish</h1>
<p>Cứ làm cái gì mình thích, bên dưới là một vài thứ hay ho bạn có thể thêm vào trong file csproj để hiển thị khi publish lên Nuget. Trong đó thuộc tính GenerateDocumentationFile sẽ cho phép giữ nguyên thông tin comment không bị mất.</p>
<description>My Awesome Package<description></description>
<generatedocumentationfile>true</generatedocumentationfile>
<packageid>AwesomePackage</packageid>
<version>1.0.0</version>
<authors>Fun Corp</authors>
<company>Fun Inc</company>

Sau khi xong xuôi thì Build lại project thử, build xong thì Pack. Giờ đây trong thư mục bin/Debug sẽ xuất hiện thêm file xxx.version.nupkg, đây chính là file bạn cần publish lên.

Giờ mở terminal lên, cd vô ngay thư mục vừa tạo ra file nupkg hồi nãy.

dotnet nuget push xxx.version.nupkg --api-key \[key hồi này mới copy] --source https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json

# 4. Xong

Vô lại nuget.org chọn Manage Packages rồi coi package đã được duyệt và listed chưa. Trong này cũng có nhiều chỗ hay ho như là update lại thông tin Readme, bla bla bla...

<p>Hồi đầu nhìn thấy có vẻ giống nhau, hơi lộn lẹo nên phải biên lại đây cho dễ nhớ.</p>
<p>Bạn sẽ nhìn thấy 3 class này khi khởi tạo dự án WebAPI (là <a href="http://ASP.NET">ASP.NET</a> Core Web API hoặc là <a href="http://ASP.NET">ASP.NET</a> Web Application (.NET Framework).</p>
<p>Theo đó thì trên .NET Framework API sẽ như bên dưới. Muốn thay đổi route thì phải chỉnh trong App_Start/WebApiConfig.cs</p>
<p><code>public class SampleAPIController : ApiController</code>\
<code>{</code>\
<code>// your code in here</code>\
<code>}</code></p>
<p>Còn trên NET Core thì tiện hơn có thể set route theo từng controller hoặc từng method luôn, khá là tiện dụng với annonation method.</p>
<p><code>[ApiController]</code>\
<code>[Router("[controller]")</code>\
<code>public class SampleAPIController : ControllerBase</code>\
<code>{</code>\
<code>// your code in here</code>\
<code>}</code></p>
<p>Còn Controller thì được dùng cho MVC web pages, tất nhiên rồi!</p>
